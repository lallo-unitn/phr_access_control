# Cryptographic Access Control for Personal Health Record Management

This project implements cryptographic access control for a Personal Health Record (PHR) management system using the Charm-Crypto library. It leverages the `abenc_maabe_rw15` scheme based on the paper ["Efficient Statically-Secure Large-Universe Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption"](http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/016.pdf).
